# 🧠 Workflow Agent System

A lightweight, extensible intelligent agent framework for Git-based development workflows.

## 🚧 Current Progress

The current implementation supports a simple pipeline:

This prototype demonstrates the core loop of sensing changes, presenting them, and waiting for user decisions.

## 🎯 Project Vision

We aim to build a modular intelligent system that can assist developers in version control decisions and streamline workflow automation.

### 🧩 System Components

| Component           | Description                                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Sensors**         | Collects environmental information, e.g., `git diff`, file status, and external APIs (e.g. CI state).         |
| **Actuators**       | Performs environment actions, e.g., generating commit messages, creating commits, or notifying users.         |
| **Agent Program**   | Core logic to determine action strategies, based on rules, history, and/or model outputs.                     |
| **Reward Function** | Evaluation metric for the agent's behavior. (e.g., commit message quality, commit frequency, scope coverage). |

## 🧠 Future Development

Planned features:

- 🧠 **Multi-model cooperative system**: Combine rule-based logic with LLM (e.g., GPT) to provide semantic-level suggestions.
- 🧮 **Decision-making module**: Learn from historical commit behavior and file influence patterns.
- 🗃️ **Embedded lightweight database**: Log agent decisions and user feedback for long-term improvement (e.g., SQLite, TinyDB).

## 🧰 Development Tools

- Prototyping: [Coze.dev](https://coze.com/) (early-stage agent development)
- Target stack: `Python` + `Git CLI` + `OpenAI API` + `SQLite` (or JSON flat DB)
- Optional integrations: GitHub Actions, Terminal UI, VSCode Extension

---

## 📚 Supervisor Feedback

- ✔️ Define the role of each development tool clearly
- ✔️ Choose a sustainable technology stack
- ✔️ Maintain a clear and extensible architecture

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- [ ] Select a future agent type: recommender / decision-maker / auto-actor
- [ ] Finalize tech stack and workflow structure
- [ ] Draft system architecture (modular components)
- [ ] Implement first smart component (e.g., diff parser → commit message suggester)
